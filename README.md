# Twitter-bots
So hey guys,hope you are doing well in this pandemic.
Since I have given a try of making a bot of twitter which can reply,retweet,like a tweet mentioning the bot.
Step1:
Make  a developer account of your Twitter bot.
Go to  https://developer.twitter.com/en and make your developer aaccount

After making that,go to create an app,
try to know your
CONSUMER_KEY = "AAAAAAAAA"
CONSUMER_SECRET ="BBBBBBBBBBB"
ACCESS_KEY= "CCCCCCCCC"
ACCESS_SECRET="DDDDDDDDDD"



in keyand token sections in the app you named.
It will be mention in your developer account as you create an app


So to make a bot you have to need two Twitter accounts.
1st account for mentioning the developer account of twitter and make a tweet of #helloworld(in my case you can use any but try to mention your hastag in code)
2nd account(developer account) for seeing the tweets or examining the bot is it working or not.

So make a tweet of #helloworld(in my case) from your 1st account.
Try to know your last seen id which you will get by clicking on the tweet of 1st account and then see your browser the last long digits of if
For example:https://twitter.com/XXXXXXXX12345/status/1234XXXXXXXXX98 last long number is your last_seen_id.


Place this number in the last_seen_id.txt which I have mention in git;
And then run your code..
Now tweet again something with #helloworld(in my case) and run the code,
To keep your code running place it in any online console of python such as https://www.pythonanywhere.com.

Voila,Your coe is running..
Thank you.
